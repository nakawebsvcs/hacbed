howWeWorkIntro: "HACBED uplifts community voice and supports collective action through our approach to community-based economic development. We play the role of facilitator, catalyst, community builder and broker as asked by the communities we serve. Holding this space, we also act as a producer of training, technical assistance, advocacy, education, as well as research & development (R&D) related products and services. HACBED has developed a body of information, experience, and expertise to support the field of community-based economic development and asset building in Hawai`i by:\n\n- Providing organizational capacity development support to grassroots organizations involved in CBED and asset building across the state and elsewhere.\n- Supporting community-based organizations through training, workshops, coaching, technical assistance, and other support services.\n- Implementing field building strategies to improve the environment in which community-based organizations must operate in Hawai`i.\n- Sitting, talking story, and listening to capture, synthesize, reflect, and sometimes translate the vision and ideas of community members.\n\nOur focus and scope of work is in the following areas:\n\n- *Community & Organizational Capacity Building* -- organizational assessments (diagnostics), strategic thinking and planning, community economic development training and technical assistance, and executive coaching to assist communities and non-profit organizations in building the capacity needed to plan, implement, and sustain community-based economic development and other asset building ventures.\n- *Community Based Planning* -- community-based planning for sustainable community-based economic development and asset building, including the designing and facilitating of community engagement and participation processes, building coalitions and networks, and developing community-based institutions.\n- *Family & Community Asset Building For Self-Sufficiency* -- developing policies and community practices around strategies that help individuals, families, and communities to build wealth/assets. These assets will then help them to become self sufficient and develop increased opportunities that will allow them to exercise choice and control over their futures."
facilitationContent: "As facilitators, HACBED staff starts with active listening to hold safe spaces for meaningful conversations. The process of facilitation is a way of providing leadership without taking the reigns, and contributing structure and process to interactions so groups are able to function effectively and make high-quality decisions. A facilitative leader focuses on both content and process.\n\n- Content = What tasks, subjects, problems are being addressed;\n- Process = How things are discussed, including Methods, Procedures, Format, Tools, Style of interaction, Group norms, Group dynamics and Group climate\n\nThe key responsibility as a facilitator is to create this group process and an environment in which it can flourish, and so help the group reach a successful decision, solution or conclusion. To facilitate effectively, HACBED staff operate objectively with a neutral stance as to solely focus on the group process. We work from a set of core values consistent with the concepts of empowerment, commitment, collaboration, learning and partnership.\n\nAll staff are required to attend [Facilitative Skills: An Essential Foundation for Collaborative Leadership](https://www.pacificcollaboration.com/), a two day facilitator training session by Donna Ching, Ph.D.\n\nFor more information on our facilitation services, please contact us."

networkContent: "Networks allow individuals and organizations with often quite different perspectives, strengths and experiences to work together to achieve a common goal. Effective networks have the potential to make immense impact on systemic change at any level -- from a community or grassroots level to a global scale.\n\nHere, across all islands of Hawai`i, HACBED works to coordinate and develop quality networks that are based on intention, accountability, and trust. As a network facilitator, HACBED designs and facilitates gatherings to help partners uplift their interests, identify challenges, and structure network activities that connect people strategically where there is mutual benefit. HACBED also catalyzes ideas into collective action through coordination and coaching. Should the network run into structural issues for itself or its communities, HACBED takes on the role of advocate to bridge disconnects between grassroots action and institutional policy.\n\nEvery network has different needs, focuses and challenges. To learn more about HACBED's role as a network weaver, please contact us.\n\n*Reference Materials on Network Development:* [Weaving Smart Networks](http://www.networkweaver.com/)"

planningContent: "Sometimes people just need to talk story. HACBED serves as an intentional listener to help communities to articulate their ideas in a safe space, synthesize ideas, and action plan their next steps. We listen to every stakeholder to ensure each voice is equally lifted up. As such, we remain connected to our \"activist\" roots by ensuring that no voice is unheard so that the organization can move forward collectively.\n\nGeneral technical assistance captures broad support we offer to people and organizations to meet them where they are at. Strategic planning is a more structured approach to how an organization determines where it is going over the next year or more, how it's going to get there, and how it will know if it got there or not. The focus of a strategic plan is usually on the entire organization, while the focus of a business plan is usually on a particular product, service or program. Our role is then to help organizations identify long term action plans through a collaborative approach with all stakeholders.\n\nThere are a variety for approaches for strategic planning and general technical assistance and HACBED's approach is founded in an asset-based mindset that lifts up the assets of the community using the appreciative inquiry method. From that base, HACBED employs a variety of techniques and models in ways that make sense for each community. The way that a strategic plan or other technical assistance is offered and developed depends on the nature of the organization's leadership, culture of the organization, complexity of the organization's environment, and size of the organization, among other considerations.\n\nFor more information on HACBED's strategic planning services or interest in receiving more general technical support, please contact us."

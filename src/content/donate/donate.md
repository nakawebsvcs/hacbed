  Aloha Kākou,


  For more than 30 years, the Hawaiʻi Alliance for Community-Based Economic Development (HACBED) has stood with communities across our islands — listening deeply, holding space for tough conversations, and supporting local solutions rooted in culture, ʻāina, and justice.


  Born out of the Hawaiian Renaissance, HACBED was founded in 1992 with a bold vision: that development in Hawai'i should be led by the people who live here — not imposed from the outside. That it should honor our values, restore our connections to land, and empower communities to define their own futures.


  From food and ʻāina justice to rethinking our relationship with tourism, HACBED continues to evolve alongside the communities we serve.


  **Why Support HACBED**


  By supporting HACBED, you are directly supporting work that advances intergenerational knowledge evolution, ʻāina and food justice, and community driven institutional change; place-based approaches to our economy, tourism, and workforce development; and relationship building and shared accountability for institutional partners and the communities with whom they collaborate. 


  We believe that people know, and people can. Communities are the experts of their own context. Our role is to listen, uplift, and help remove barriers so that families and grassroots organizations can do what they do best: care for one another and the places they call home.


  By supporting HACBED, you support HACBED's efforts behind the scenes to:


  * Provide training, technical assistance, and research to support community-based economic initiatives

  * Build capacity in local organizations and families so they have the tools to act on their own priorities

  * Gather and share stories, data, and lessons to inform systems change

  * Create networks across sectors to seed collaboration

  * Hold space for new and long-time leaders to work together toward community transformation


  Together, we can continue shaping a Hawaiʻi where communities have the choice and control to thrive — now and for generations to come.

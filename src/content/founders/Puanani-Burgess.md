bio: "Puanani Burgess, or Aunty Pua, is a community building facilitator, trainer and consultant in Hawai'i, the U.S., and throughout the Pacific. She is also a poet and cultural translator noted for her experience in community, family and values-based economic development, mediation, and storytelling processes. Aunty Pua is also well known is a process designer and facilitator for Building the Beloved Community, a community-building and conflict transformation process based on bringing people face to face for ceremony, storytelling, and healing circles of trust and respect. Aunty Pua has been involved in the Native Hawaiian sovereignty movement and several key community struggles (Protect Kaho'olawe 'Ohana, West Beach Development struggle, founding the Wai'anae Coast Community Alternative Development Corporation, etc…), which led her, along with the other founders, to form HACBED as an aloha response to economic development that did not include the people it was affecting. Aunty Pua's initial community-based economic development initiative was the Backyard Aquaculture Program. Taking principles from ancient fish ponds and aloha 'āina, the program provided families with tanks, fish, and training on how to take care of them."

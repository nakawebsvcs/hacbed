name: "Charlie Reppun"
bio: "Credited as one of the most influential taro growers in Hawaiʻi, Uncle Charlie, along with his brothers and children, uses this ancient practice as a tool for community bridging and community-based economic development. Throughout the 1990's and into the early 2000's, Uncle Charlie and other Windward and Leeward farmers and community activists worked to restore water to streams previously diverted for corporate agriculture and golf courses. His work in community and willingness to teach others was instrumental to the formation of HACBED. As a part of a non-profit, Hui 'Ulu Mea 'Ai, he and other farmers in the network promoted food growth and started a small food processing plant in Waiāhole Valley. Uncle Charlie and his ʻohana continue to grow taro in Waiāhole."

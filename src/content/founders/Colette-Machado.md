name: "Colette Machado"
bio: "Seeing a need for Hawaiian people to connect with their cultural practice, Colette Machado began the Limu Project as a part of Ke Kua'ƒÅina Hanauna Hou. This practice in connection to cultural and indigenous practice, coupled with community-based economic development, led to Colette joining with the other founders to establish HACBED. Colette's background placed her as a defender of coastal zones, shoreline use, fish ponds, and cultural sites as well as in collaboration with Hui Alaloa and Protect Kaho'olawe. Colette served as the chairwoman for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs."

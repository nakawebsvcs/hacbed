name: "Eric Enos"
bio: "Eric Enos is the co-founder and Executive Director of Kaʻala Farms, a Waiʻanae-based community organization that has operated the Cultural Learning Center at Kaʻala for nearly three decades. As a lifelong resident of Waiʻanae, Eric is deeply involved in the perpetuation of our cultural and ancestral traditions, as well as the management, care and restoration of our land and sea. Kaʻala Farms started as an initiative to provide youth an alternative opportunity for their own development and has evolved into an organization with a mission on the transmission of cultural knowledge from kūpuna to ʻōpio; protection and restoration of the ahupuaʻa with an emphasis on attendant rights and responsibilities; and integration of cultural knowledge, wisdom and practices into educational institutions that serve children. Uncle Eric's commitment to mālama ʻāina and to the Waiʻanae Coast community led him to working with other CBED practitioners to form HACBED."

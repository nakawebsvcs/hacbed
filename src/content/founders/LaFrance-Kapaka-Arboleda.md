bio: "The late LaFrance Kapaka-Arboleda, known by many as Aunty LaFrance, was a respected cultural activist born in Anahola, Kaua'i. She was instrumental in securing the community's rights to steward the 1,600-acre ahupua'a of Waipā, which catalyzed much of HACBED's work on Kaua'i and resulted in the eventual formation of both HACBED and the Waipā Foundation. As stated by the foundation formed in LaFrance's name, 'She was a champion of the underprivileged and a defender of those who couldn't defend themselves.'"

A member of the Hāna community on Maui, Bill founded the nonprofit organization Hina Malailena, which oversaw development of the Hāna Village Marketplace. The project intended to create opportunities for local families in Hāna to create and sustain businesses. This venture ultimately did not get off the ground for a variety of reasons and provided many lessons learned to the community based economic development field in Hawaiʻi."

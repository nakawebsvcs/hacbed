The North Shore Community Land Trust (NSCLT) protects, stewards, and enhances the natural landscapes, cultural heritage, and rural character of ahupuaʻa (traditional land divisions) from Kahuku Point to Kaʻena. They act to protect one of our most precious and threatened natural resources: the spectacular lands of the North Shore of Oʻahu. Since their founding, they have been involved in saving thousands of acres of open space and have also participated in related ʻāina-based efforts such as the [Hinaʻi Network](https://www.hacbed.org/planning-projects/north-shore-community-land-trust-strategic-plan-update/webdev/hacbed/current-projects/hinai-hawaii-center-for-sustainable-food-and-agriculture/).

HACBED assisted the NSCLT in updating their strategic plan. Using analyses of current work and on-island climate, HACBED staff members facilitated a process that will help to guide the organization’s short- and long-term actions, ultimately ensuring that their efforts continue to shape and preserve land on the North Shore.

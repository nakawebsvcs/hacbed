Hālau Kū Māna (HKM) is a Hawaiian focused public charter school in Makiki that serves students from 4th through 12th grades, whose purpose is to provide a quality educational program that is academically rigorous, culturally and spiritually grounded, and community designed and controlled.

Due to the fact that high impact decisions must be made in the near future, the strategic planning process largely focuses on collecting as much data and information as possible from various Hālau Kū Māna stakeholders including faculty members, staff members, administrators, board members, students and their families, as well as community members and organizational partners. It is of the utmost importance that honest and unfiltered opinions and feedback  are captured in this process. This information is gathered through face-to-face meetings, phone interviews, in-person interviews, focus groups, and workshops.

In essence, this plan will help to develop clearer organizational alignment, which in turn will make the decision making process and implementation more effective. By engaging all stakeholders and valuing all of the ideas and opinions provided, the organization can move as a cohesive unit, even if a complete consensus cannot be achieved. This is because the organizational transparency and clear lines of communication allow all parties involved to feel appreciated and understood.

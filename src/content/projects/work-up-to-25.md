HACBED developed a body of information, experience, and expertise to support the field of community-based economic development and asset building in Hawaiʻi by:

* Providing organizational capacity development support to grassroots organizations involved in CBED and asset building across the state and elsewhere.
* Supporting community-based organizations through training, workshops, coaching, technical assistance, and other support services.
* Implementing field building strategies to improve the environment in which community-based organizations must operate in Hawai‘i. 
* Sitting, talking story, and listening to capture, synthesize, reflect, and sometimes translate the vision and ideas of community members.

HACBEDʻs focus and scope of work was in the following areas:

* *Community & Organizational Capacity Building* – organizational assessments (diagnostics), strategic thinking and planning, community economic development training and technical assistance, and executive coaching to assist communities and non-profit organizations in building the capacity needed to plan, implement, and sustain community-based economic development and other asset building ventures.
* *Community Based Planning* – community-based planning for sustainable community-based economic development and asset building, including the designing and facilitating of community engagement and participation processes, building coalitions and networks, and developing community-based institutions.
* *Family & Community Asset Building For Self-Sufficiency* – developing policies and community practices around strategies that help individuals, families, and communities to build wealth/assets. These assets will then help them to become self sufficient and develop increased opportunities that will allow them to exercise choice and control over their futures.
* *Finance and Fund Development* -- providing trainings and technical assistance to assist low-income communities and non-profit community based economic development (CBED) organizations in developing viable financial and funding strategies to plan and implement their community and economic development ventures (projects, programs, and businesses).

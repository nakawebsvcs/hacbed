In January 2018, [EPIC ʻOhana](http://epicohana.net/) celebrated the 20th anniversary of the organization as a non-profit serving families in the child welfare system. As part of the anniversary, EPIC ʻOhana worked towards a five-year strategic plan. The plan has three impact areas:

1. To strengthen internally (professional development, staff well-being, organizational culture)
2. To strengthen the families and the young people they serve (to have impactful and effective processes, and to utilize feedback as a learning organization)
3. To strengthen community (by engaging in courageous conversations including the voices of families and young people, to listen deeply to the needs and concerns of Child Welfare Services)

As part of the strategic planning process, HACBED staff members met with members from all of EPIC ʻOhana’s programs including ʻOhana Conferencing Field and Coordination, Youth Circles, Family Findings, Wrap, Independent Living Collaborative (ILC), and HI HOPES. In addition, HACBED met with EPIC ʻOhana members who were not stationed on Oʻahu including those in Hilo, Kona, and on Maui. HACBED staff members also met with various Child Welfare Services units including those in Honolulu, Kapolei, Kona, and Hilo to collect their feedback on EPIC ʻOhana services. HACBED was excited to support EPIC ʻOhana and, by extension, Child Welfare Services Division staff members.

Through a contract with Hi’ilei Aloha, HACBED assisted the Waiohuli Homesteaders Association with the development of a business plan for phase one of its community center. The development of the Commercial Kitchen is the first phase of what will eventually become a larger Waiohuli Community Center and Park.  The site is situated within the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands 5,112 acre master Planned Kula project on the island of Maui.  This master planned community is within the Waiohuli ahupua‘a situated on the western slope of Haleakala.

To achieve its goals to support the more than 200 homestead residents in Waiohuli, WHHA is focused on the development of a community center that would accommodate spaces for events, office and program space for social and cultural organizations, and areas for child care, passive activity, and active recreation.  In addition, WHHA continues to organize and implement a range of community activities, be actively involved with local issues that impact homestead residents, and increase its ability to provide a range of programs and services for residents.

## General Plan Outreach Support: 
The [County of Hawaiʻi General Plan (GP)](https://www.planning.hawaiicounty.gov/general-plan-community-planning/gp) is a strategic plan that identifies the vision and priorities important to the people of Hawaiʻi County to guide the pattern of future development. HACBED supported the Planning Department with an outreach process that was designed to authentically engage community members across the island to integrate community voice into the draft General Plan (GP).

A participatory community planning process, Speak Outs, was the underlying method to engage with community members and capture meaningful feedback on the GP draft. [Community Development Plan Action Committee (CDP AC)](https://www.planning.hawaiicounty.gov/general-plan-community-planning/cdp) members who work on regional plans were also engaged to be of support at the larger community wide Speak Outs. In addition, Planning staff members were trained so as to be able to share about the Speak Out process and drum up support with community partners. Finally, HACBED provided additional outreach support including creating an [overview video of the GP process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXC1P-OdgaQ&feature=emb_logo), documenting the outreach process, reviewing outreach materials, and facilitating follow-up topic-specific workshops.
Hawaiʻi County is currently engaged in the comprehensive review of the Final draft General Plan 2045. 

## Community Development Plan Outreach Support: 
Hawaiʻi Island’s [Community Development Plans (CDPs)](https://www.planning.hawaiicounty.gov/general-plan-community-planning/cdp) are intended to translate broad General Plan Goals, Policies, and Standards into implementation Actions as they apply to specific geographical regions around Hawaiʻi Island. HACBED supports Hawaiʻi County with: 
- Internal Coordination & Planning Support 
- Community Engagement Training & Capacity Building
- CDP Action Committee (AC) Engagement 
- Public Workshops 

Previously, HACBED partnered with Hawaiʻi County Office of Planning and Islander Institute with the development of region specific Community Development Plans (CDPs) for Kaʻū and Hāmākua.

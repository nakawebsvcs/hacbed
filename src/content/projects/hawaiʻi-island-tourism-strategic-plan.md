HACBED supported the [Hawai‘i County Department of Research & Development](https://www.hawaiicounty.gov/departments/research-and-development) to update the [2006-2016 Hawai‘i Island Tourism Strategic Plan](http://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/op/spb/DRAFT_CEDS_09.20.16.pdf) to include current local and global trends looking towards 2020-2025. The updated Plan reflects Hawai‘i Island’s commitment to “Ola I ka ‘Āina, Ola ke Kānaka — Healthy Land, Healthy People — understanding that by making the island more connected, healthy land, healthy people, and a healthy visitor industry will be created. HACBED worked with the County on background research on local and global trends, stakeholder engagement with individuals and groups from the community, the visitor industry, cultural practitioners, and others, as well as network gatherings to engage the broader community.

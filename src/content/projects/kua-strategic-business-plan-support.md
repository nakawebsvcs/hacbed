HACBED partnered with Kua‘āina Ulu ‘Auamo ([KUA](http://kuahawaii.org/)), “a backbone organization that supports grassroots growing through shared responsibility.” HACBED was asked to support a strategic planning-like process combined with additional financial training and organizational assessment. The goals of the process included:

1. Increasing the level of comfort (capacity building) for KUA staff members, administrators, and board members when reviewing financial documents
2. Analyzing KUA’s current fundraising-related activities to identify strengths as well as potential inefficiencies
3. Sharing KUA’s general financial approach and strategy with the broader KUA network (transparency) to serve as an organizational model
4. Supporting KUA’s administrators and staff members in streamlining organizational processes and opening internal lines of communication

This was accomplished through a number of activities including, but not limited to:

* Staff member and administrator interviews
* Market research 
* The creation of financial templates
* Data gathering
* Workshops

The findings and information from all of the activities above were summarized in a report document for internal use.

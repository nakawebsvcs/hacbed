On November 9, 2020 the Office of Council Services contracted [Hawaiian Community Assets ](http://www.hawaiiancommunity.net/)(HCA) to engage the Maui community around solutions for affordable housing. This feedback will help to inform recommendations for a comprehensive affordable housing plan to be reviewed and approved by the Maui County Council in June 2021. 

Following initial community outreach, HACBED supported the HCA team in carrying out four share back meetings in April 2021 to gather feedback from the community on initial recommendations. HACBED provided planning, coordination, and documentation support during the four virtual share back meetings. After each meeting, the HACBED team captured summaries and reflections shared by participants, from which HCA was able to strengthen the previously drafted recommendations.   

In addition to collecting manaʻo, these share back meetings empowered several community members to call their representatives, volunteer to be affordable housing advocates, and offer their professional skills in support of this plan.

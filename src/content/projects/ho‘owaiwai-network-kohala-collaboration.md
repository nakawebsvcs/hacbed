Building on the work of network partners–including a diverse coalition of nonprofits, government departments, social service agencies, and businesses–HACBED worked to determine the feasibility of expanding and deepening the impact of the Hoʻowaiwai Network by conducting a planning process with support for potential pilots in collaboration with partners in North Hawaiʻi. The planning process included the development of a coalition of partners in North Hawaiʻi with an end goal of developing an Action Plan and facilitating evaluation planning for partner integration of [2Gen outcomes](https://ascend.aspeninstitute.org/two-generation/what-is-2gen/) and data sharing. 

Utilizing core Design Thinking concepts, preliminary outreach was conducted to gain a better understanding of community needs. Understanding that empathy is the foundation of community-centered design, it was important to engage with end-users. Through this process, partners emphasized the need for service provision and resource sharing in North Hawaiʻi. Fittingly, the Hoʻowaiwai Network has 2 initiatives that were piloted to meet this need: HoloMUA and Resources Match. HACBED leveraged Network partners to provide rotating HoloMUA services in Kohala and provided training and updates to Resources Match. 

This multi-level approach to improve access to resources and collaboration in North Hawaiʻi provides opportunities for families, adults, and children together, to access empowering resources.

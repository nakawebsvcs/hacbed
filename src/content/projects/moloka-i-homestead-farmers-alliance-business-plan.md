In June 2016, HACBED was contracted by the [Insight Center for Community Economic Development](http://www.insightcced.org/) through the support of the Department of Hawaiian Homelands (DHHL) to assist the Moloka`i Homestead Farmers Alliance (MHFA) with business planning services. DHHL has contracted a number of organizations — including [HANO](http://hano-hawaii.org/newhano/) — to provide capacity building and needed technical assistance.

Specifically, MHFA was given funds to repair Lanikeha Center in Ho’olehua, Moloka’i. Business planning services provided ensured that repairs and subsequent activities will be carried out effectively and for the benefit of the surrounding community.

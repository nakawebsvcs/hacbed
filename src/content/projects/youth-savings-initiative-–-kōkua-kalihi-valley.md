With a generous grant from the Atherton Foundation and support from Hawaiʻi USA Federal Credit Union and Bank of Hawaiʻi, HACBED and Kōkua Kalihi Valley (KKV) have partnered to offer the participants in their bike exchange program an opportunity to earn match savings and bonus cash incentives by attending a series of financial education and life skills workshops.

The Kalihi Valley Instructional Bike Exchange (KVIBE) is a bicycle repair and recycling program where youth in the community volunteer their time and provide a service to the community of Kalihi while learning to work with their hands and gain invaluable life skills. Youth who are highly involved in the program, are invited to participate in the Youth Savings Initiative.

This year’s workshops will run from February to June and participants will have opportunities to earn money from two neighborhood bike sale opportunities. They will also have an opportunity to earn an additional $125 through matching funds and other incentives.

While recognizing that financial literacy and capability are core to a stable and prosperous future, we also understand that wealth is not always defined in monetary terms and money should not be the sole driver for making decisions throughout life. We recognize that the support of family, friends, and community are fundamental for success. This program has been designed to help participants set goals based on their own values, beliefs and dreams by introducing them to successful members of their own community who serve as mentors, guides, and role models, giving them the tools and education to become prosperous, high achieving adults.

In the past year, HACBED provided strategic planning services to Going Home Hawai’i, a consortium of over 50 public and private entities currently totaling over 250 members. The goal of this group is to help reintegrate former offenders and formerly incarcerated individuals into the community and the workplace. Due to various factors, including the stigma attached to being formerly incarcerated, these individuals often have a very hard time acquiring adequate housing and employment, despite being qualified.

Over a period of about one year, we were able to work with representatives from various organizations to help shape Going Home’s new strategic plan. The meetings in West Hawai’i were held in the Workforce Development Division Office in Kailua-Kona and input for the West Hawai’i division was collected from members of HOPE Services Hawai’i, the Hawai’i State Judiciary, the Department of Public Safety, Hawai’i Corrections Division, the Hawai’i County Office, the District Court, CARE Hawai’i, the Neighborhood Place of Kona, Labor Ready, Cornerstone Christian Fellowship, and the Hamakua Health Center.

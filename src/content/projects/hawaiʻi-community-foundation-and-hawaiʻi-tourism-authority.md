In February of 2013, the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority (HTA) selected the Hawai‘i Community Foundation (HCF) as its new partner to manage two of its Product Enrichment Programs – Kūkulu Ola: Living Hawaiian Culture Program (LHCP) and Natural Resources Program (NRP).  This new partnership provided an opportunity for HTA and HCF to reflect on the past achievements of the programs and think strategically on how best to maximize the intended impacts of the programs moving forward.  This process engaged advisory council members for the two programs, community stakeholders, and HTA/HCF in reflective and strategic dialogue sessions.

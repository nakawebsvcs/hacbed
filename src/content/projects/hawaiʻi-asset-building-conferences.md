In December 2010 and June 2012 HACBED and the statewide Hoʻowaiwai Network convened local and national asset building leaders in statewide symposia. A symposium, according to the American Heritage Dictionary, is “a convivial meeting for drinking, music, and intellectual discussion among the ancient Greeks.” True to the spirit of HACBED, these symposia created a space for people to engage in meaningful dialogue, relevant to the work and driven towards action, having fun all the while.

Each symposium brought together a diverse range of caring individuals from communities – families, youth, policymakers, community practitioners, financial institutions, employers, resource partners – who were interested and passionate about organizing around actions that address asset poverty and building the wealth and financial stability of Hawaiʻi's working families to empower themselves to increase their self-sufficiency. Participants came from every island and guests from across the nation – all of whom were and still are asset building experts in their own right. Each symposium served as a space to share, collaborate, and discuss strategies and tools for action to increase family and community assets within the unique context of Hawaiʻi.

**Springboard To Prosperity: Building the Financial Stability, Wealth, & Well-Being of Hawaiʻi's Working Families (December 9 & 10, 2010)**

This day-and-a-half statewide symposium brought over 200 local and national experts from all walks of life together in Kailua-Kona, Hawaiʻi Island to share and build genuine wealth together, the Island way.

Sessions included:

* Discussions on innovative ways that credit unions, schools and nonprofits partner to help youth open accounts and save.
* How different models of financial education training help families to meet monthly expenses while planning for the future.
* Identifying and organizing around asset building campaigns and actions at the State, Local, Community, and Family levels.

San Francisco Treasurer and then Co-Chair of the National Cities for Financial Empowerment Jose Cisneros was the keynote speaker. Cisneros shared what local governments were doing to help families save, increase financial literacy, and find jobs in their communities.

**Kahua O Ke Ola: Foundations for Prosperity (June 27-29, 2012)**

In 2017, the HACBED team convened close partners and supporters to celebrate HACBED’s 25th Anniversary as well as listen to feedback on areas of need for our community and institutional partners. The following themes that emerged or were affirmed included:

* Transition is a dangerous period. It works best when values are passed on -- shared values help to guide the vision.
* HACBED's core competency is holding space -- spaces for tough conversations.
* We exist to serve this place and those who choose to be of this place.
* Community Based Economic Development (CBED) in Hawaiʻi is our kākoʻo economic development. Every family has kākoʻo of caring for fish in an area -- they would go there and feed the fish. Our kuleana is to feed the fish first, before they feed us -- this is CBED.
* Finding people among us who can make bridges is just as important as the CBED vision. We have to be strategic about how to identify people in the power structure.
* We also collectively committed to bucketing our work into the following areas:

  * *Intergenerational Knowledge Evolution* -- collaborating with partners who are supporting leaders from different generations to transition into new roles as tied to their organizations and communities.
  * *‘Āina & Food Justice* -- reaffirming our connection to our roots in support of ‘āina, that which feeds us, and ‘āina-based organizations that steward those places to drive our work as tied to food system and justice issues.
  * *Community Driven Institutional Support* -- working with individuals connected with institutions who are committed to this place and supporting their efforts to push these systems to be more community driven and community accountable.

In 2022, the HACBED team reconvened close partners for HACBED’s [30th Anniversary](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=c3e5a7ebe24243829c48c28b70967188), which was particularly momentous as we were all reemerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Leading up to HACBED’s anniversary, the team observed the following lessons learned over the past five years:

* Connection and interrelation between our work related to Intergenerational Knowledge Evolution and ‘Āina & Food Justice as ‘āina-based work sees a generational shift.
* Virtual gatherings increased access in some ways and created new challenges as tied to process design considerations & facilitation techniques given the change in the way folks connect online and the increased distractions as well as decreased attention spans.
* Increased importance of mental & emotional health awareness and self-care, which is also partially related to the new remote work world and impacts of virtual gatherings.
* Potential area for attention is related to Community Driven Institutional Support given the increasing capacity of community-based organizations and the need to support institutions to build their capacities to engage with communities.

The team also used some of 2020 and 2021 to reconnect with our Founders to see what they were observing. This subsequently led to themes to frame the 30th Anniversary:

* Kākou -- all of us, including non-humans
* Climate Change -- physical & social impacts
* Steady State / No Growth
* Cultural Wellness
* Reimagining Tourism -- commitment to place; mutual learning about stories of places & people
* Support for Community Organizing -- meeting facilitation & mediation skills

The HACBED team distilled Founder, board, and team feedback to the following statement for the 30th Anniversary: “Coming together with a mindset of kākou, including all living creatures to rethink how we as a community can organize to reimagine our economy towards a vision of cultural wellness as we face climate change in both physical and social embodiments.”

The HACBED team built on the 3 buckets out of the 25th Anniversary towards clusters to get feedback and guidance from our founders, partners and friends in World Cafe style talk story sessions:

* *ʻĀina, Community Control of Land, and Food Security* -- need to conserve land, flora, and fauna first and the subsequent difficulties tied to land issues in Hawai‘i and the need to build community capacity.
* *Impacts of COVID to Revisit our Economy, Tourism, and Place-Based Workforce Development* -- COVID highlighted the importance of local food systems, the opportunity to be innovative, and the need to develop sustainable and mutually beneficial tourism practices.
* *Moving Education Systems Towards Spaces of Healing* -- the challenges of integrating cultural and place-based learning in western education models and cultural differences and power dynamics in university settings.
* *Reengaging Spaces of Power* -- being mindful of where power lies and who gets a seat at the table as well as acknowledging that there is power in people coming together.

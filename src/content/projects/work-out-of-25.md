In 2017, the HACBED team convened close partners and supporters to celebrate HACBED’s 25th Anniversary as well as listen to feedback on areas of need for our community and institutional partners. The following themes that emerged or were affirmed included:

* Transition is a dangerous period. It works best when values are passed on -- shared values help to guide the vision.
* HACBED's core competency is holding space -- spaces for tough conversations.
* We exist to serve this place and those who choose to be of this place.
* Community Based Economic Development (CBED) in Hawaiʻi is our kākoʻo economic development. Every family has kākoʻo of caring for fish in an area -- they would go there and feed the fish. Our kuleana is to feed the fish first, before they feed us -- this is CBED.
* Finding people among us who can make bridges is just as important as the CBED vision. We have to be strategic about how to identify people in the power structure.
* We also collectively committed to bucketing our work into the following areas:

In 2022, the HACBED team reconvened close partners for HACBED’s [30th Anniversary](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=c3e5a7ebe24243829c48c28b70967188), which was particularly momentous as we were all reemerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Leading up to HACBED’s anniversary, the team observed the following lessons learned over the past five years:

* Connection and interrelation between our work related to Intergenerational Knowledge Evolution and ‘Āina & Food Justice as ‘āina-based work sees a generational shift.
* Virtual gatherings increased access in some ways and created new challenges as tied to process design considerations & facilitation techniques given the change in the way folks connect online and the increased distractions as well as decreased attention spans.
* Increased importance of mental & emotional health awareness and self-care, which is also partially related to the new remote work world and impacts of virtual gatherings.
* Potential area for attention is related to Community Driven Institutional Support given the increasing capacity of community-based organizations and the need to support institutions to build their capacities to engage with communities.

The team also used some of 2020 and 2021 to reconnect with our Founders to see what they were observing. This subsequently led to themes to frame the 30th Anniversary:

* Kākou -- all of us, including non-humans
* Climate Change -- physical & social impacts
* Steady State / No Growth
* Cultural Wellness
* Reimagining Tourism -- commitment to place; mutual learning about stories of places & people
* Support for Community Organizing -- meeting facilitation & mediation skills

The HACBED team distilled Founder, board, and team feedback to the following statement for the 30th Anniversary: “Coming together with a mindset of kākou, including all living creatures to rethink how we as a community can organize to reimagine our economy towards a vision of cultural wellness as we face climate change in both physical and social embodiments.”

The HACBED team built on the 3 buckets out of the 25th Anniversary towards clusters to get feedback and guidance from our founders, partners and friends in World Cafe style talk story sessions:

* *ʻĀina, Community Control of Land, and Food Security* -- need to conserve land, flora, and fauna first and the subsequent difficulties tied to land issues in Hawai‘i and the need to build community capacity.
* *Impacts of COVID to Revisit our Economy, Tourism, and Place-Based Workforce Development* -- COVID highlighted the importance of local food systems, the opportunity to be innovative, and the need to develop sustainable and mutually beneficial tourism practices.
* *Moving Education Systems Towards Spaces of Healing* -- the challenges of integrating cultural and place-based learning in western education models and cultural differences and power dynamics in university settings.
* *Reengaging Spaces of Power* -- being mindful of where power lies and who gets a seat at the table as well as acknowledging that there is power in people coming together.

### *Intergenerational Knowledge Evolution*

![intergenerational knowledge](src/assets/images/blog/intergenerational-knowledge.png)

Collaborating with partners who are supporting leaders from different generations to transition into new roles as tied to their organizations and communities. This work includes: 

* *[Kula No Na Po‘e Hawai‘i & Papakōlea Community Development Corporation Strategic Planning](/projects/kula-no-na-poe-hawaii-papakōlea-community-development-corporation-strategic-planning/)* -- HACBED has provided [Kula No Nā Po‘e Hawai‘i](https://kula-papakolea.com/) (KULA) and Papakōlea Community Development Corporation (PCDC) with strategic planning support services.

* *Partners In Development Foundation* -- In 2022, HACBED supported [Partners in Development Foundation](https://pidf.org/)’s (PIDF) Strategic Plan implementation. The leadership and program management teams convened and collaborated to solidify existing strategic plan goals and outcomes, create detailed action steps to measure progress, and identify staff roles necessary in order to move towards achieving identified outcomes by the end of PIDF’s three-year target period.

### *‘Āina & Food Justice*

* *MAʻO Māʻona* -- HACBED was contracted by MAʻO Organic Farms to support their Administration for Native Americans (ANA) grant project by providing planning and facilitation support for their Māʻona project, specifically the ‘Auwai Consortium and Employer Hui Focus Group Convenings, including:

* *Coastal Biocultural Restoration as a Nexus for Innovation Workshop* -- HACBED provided facilitation support to [Purple Maiʻa Foundation](https://purplemaia.org/) for its [National Science Foundation (NSF) Convergence Accelerator](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/) project: Coastal Biocultural Restoration as a Nexus for Innovation Workshop, which was hosted virtually from May 13, 2021 through May 17, 2021. Engaging 314 participants from 6 countries and 10 U.S. states, the workshop convened a diverse group representing different sectors of society, including Indigenous Peoples / Native Hawaiians, scientists, businesses/corporations, government officials, tribal leaders, university leaders, cultural practitioners and community-based nonprofit leaders to develop project ideas and define priorities for use-inspired research and application centered around the process and practice of coastal biocultural restoration. As part of its workshop support, HACBED assisted with the planning and lead facilitation of Aho (Track) 1 – Coastal Biocultural Restoration for Resilience: Food & Flooding and Aho 3: Sustainable Development and Coastal Biocultural Restoration.  In addition to the actual workshop facilitation, the scope of work included assistance to the planning team in designing the workshop to effectively identify priorities for high-impact applications of biocultural restoration, sharing of successful models, and strengthening of network connections, along with workshops debriefs, and report support focused on review and feedback. The workshop was the third step in the [Convergence Accelerator Program Model’s](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence-accelerator/program-model.jsp) Ideation Process and the final report will assist NSF in selecting future track topic(s). Selected tracks will move into the Convergence Research Focus phase and will be released in a program solicitation with selected awards focusing on the acceleration of basic research into practice and the leveraging of multidisciplinary approach / partnerships with funding of up to $750K for a 9 months planning phase and funding of up to $5M for the subsequent 24 months solutions development phase.

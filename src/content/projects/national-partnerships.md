The National Community Reinvestment Coalition and its grassroots member organizations create opportunities for people to build wealth. They work with community leaders, policymakers and financial institutions to champion fairness in banking, housing and business. HACBED serves as a board member.


HACBED is a member of the Prosperity Now Community Steering Committee and contributor to the Prosperity Now Scorecard. Prosperity Now (formally CFED) offers a unique combination of scalable practical solutions, in-depth research and proven policy solutions, all aimed at building wealth for those who need it most.


Cities for Financial Empowerment Coalition (CFE Coalition) brings together pioneering municipal governments from across the country that have begun to use their power and positions to advance innovative financial empowerment initiatives. Its 15 member cities representing almost 22 million people have made tangible, measurable commitments to supporting financial empowerment programming, and both teach and learn from one another. HACBED is a member of the coalition.


HACBED is a part of the coalition at National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development (National CAPACD). Collectively the coalition improves the lives of over two-million Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) who live in poverty by providing voice, tools, and shared knowledge to drive change.

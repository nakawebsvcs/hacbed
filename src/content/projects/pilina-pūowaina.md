Pilina Pūowaina is a project initiated by Kula no nā Poʻe Hawaiʻi (Kula) to explore the possibility of a Papakōlea Hawaiian Homestead Kupuna Supportive Living Center (KSLC). This community-driven initiative is aimed at engaging Native Hawaiian beneficiaries from Papakōlea, Kewalo, and Kalāwahine and examines the social and structural factors impacting Native Hawaiian Health on Hawaiian Homelands. The Project Team includes: Group70 (G70), Department of Hawaiian Homelands, and the John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) Department of Native Hawaiian Health. This project is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 

HACBED is supporting Kula with overall internal planning, as well as community and home conversation planning, and project evaluation. The community conversations will engage community members on topics related to the KSLC, including history and culture, aging in place and health, aging in place and research, land use and policy, fund development, and site layout and design; while the home conversations are an opportunity to engage families who may not typically participate in their own home. HACBED is specifically supporting Kula and the Pilina Pūowaina project through: 

* Coordinating and facilitating internal and project team meetings
* Process design, note taking, and synthesis support for the community and home conversations
* Project evaluation support to meet funding guidelines

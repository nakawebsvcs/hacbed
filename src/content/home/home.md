reflectionsContent: "The vision was given a name, Community-Based Economic Development (CBED), and an organization was founded to advance it. The Hawai`i Alliance for Community Based Economic Development (HACBED) is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, established in 1992, designed to encourage increased investment in community-based approaches to economic development. Consistent with its philosophy of community-driven change, HACBED was formed as a membership-based entity, governed by community-based, nonprofit organizations that are CBED practitioners.\n\nSince then, HACBED has supported community-based economic development by being a facilitator, a catalyst, a broker, and a producer of training, technical assistance, advocacy, education, as well as research & development (R&D) related products and services. Based on experiences in and with community, HACBED has moved away from a member-based model as membership is not as important in the scheme of building a broader movement."
currentSupportDesc: "HACBED provides ongoing support to communities and organizations across Hawai'i through our three core service areas. Each area represents our commitment to empowering communities and fostering sustainable economic development."
pastSupportDesc: "Over our 30+ year history, HACBED has worked with numerous organizations and communities throughout Hawai'i. These past projects have helped shape our approach and continue to inform our current work."

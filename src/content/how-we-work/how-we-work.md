    As facilitators, HACBED staff starts with active listening to hold safe spaces for meaningful conversations. The process of facilitation is a way of providing leadership without taking the reigns, and contributing structure and process to interactions so groups are able to function effectively and make high-quality decisions. A facilitative leader focuses on both content and process.

    - Content = What tasks, subjects, problems are being addressed;
    - Process = How things are discussed, including Methods, Procedures, Format, Tools, Style of interaction, Group norms, Group dynamics and Group climate

    The key responsibility as a facilitator is to create this group process and an environment in which it can flourish, and so help the group reach a successful decision, solution or conclusion. To facilitate effectively, HACBED staff operate objectively with a neutral stance as to solely focus on the group process. We work from a set of core values consistent with the concepts of empowerment, commitment, collaboration, learning and partnership.

    All staff are required to attend [Facilitative Skills: An Essential Foundation for Collaborative Leadership](https://www.pacificcollaboration.com/), a two day facilitator training session by Donna Ching, Ph.D.

    Networks allow individuals and organizations with often quite different perspectives, strengths and experiences to work together to achieve a common goal. Effective networks have the potential to make immense impact on systemic change at any level -- from a community or grassroots level to a global scale.
    
    Here, across all islands of Hawaiʻi, HACBED works to coordinate and develop quality networks that are based on intention, accountability, and trust. As a network facilitator, HACBED designs and facilitates gatherings to help partners uplift their interests, identify challenges, and structure network activities that connect people strategically where there is mutual benefit. HACBED also catalyzes ideas into collective action through coordination and coaching. Should the network run into structural issues for itself or its communities, HACBED takes on the role of advocate to bridge disconnects between grassroots action and institutional policy.
    
    Every network has different needs, focuses and challenges. To learn more about HACBED's role as a network weaver, please contact us.

    Sometimes people just need to talk story. HACBED serves as an intentional listener to help communities to articulate their ideas in a safe space, synthesize ideas, and action plan their next steps. We listen to every stakeholder to ensure each voice is equally lifted up. As such, we remain connected to our "activist" roots by ensuring that no voice is unheard so that the organization can move forward collectively.
    
    General technical assistance captures broad support we offer to people and organizations to meet them where they are at. Strategic planning is a more structured approach to how an organization determines where it is going over the next year or more, how it's going to get there, and how it will know if it got there or not. The focus of a strategic plan is usually on the entire organization, while the focus of a business plan is usually on a particular product, service or program. Our role is then to help organizations identify long term action plans through a collaborative approach with all stakeholders.
    
    There are a variety for approaches for strategic planning and general technical assistance and HACBED's approach is founded in an asset-based mindset that lifts up the assets of the community using the appreciative inquiry method. From that base, HACBED employs a variety of techniques and models in ways that make sense for each community. The way that a strategic plan or other technical assistance is offered and developed depends on the nature of the organization's leadership, culture of the organization, complexity of the organization's environment, and size of the organization, among other considerations.
